# The Final Banana

## Description

Our goal is to create a POS system to use for an outfitters store. 

* It will be based on angular
* Multiple users should be possible - including admin and normal employee
* Each store item should have the following:
	1. Name
	2. Category
	3. Cost
	4. Cost per unit (Not shown on storefront)
* The UI will be scalable, to be able to used on both desktop, and mobile

## Installation

## Updates:

* We have attempted: 	The base layout of the project,
			base principles of how things work together,
			simple working sales page
* We have had roadblocks: getting routing to work properly
* We have decided to scratch: nothing at this time
* We plan on having working for presentation: a basic P.O.S system

## Other Goals:

* If we have time, we also hope to use a rental system.
* Adding a reports function - with graphs

## Original Goals not met
* The storefront should have a employee storefront
* The storefront should also have a customer version, used for online purchases that can be embedded
* Ability to have color/size options - ability to have different cost
